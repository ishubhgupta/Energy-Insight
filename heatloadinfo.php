                    <p>Our advanced predictive model leverages machine learning algorithms to accurately estimate the heating and cooling loads of buildings based on their architectural features. By analyzing key parameters such as relative compactness, surface area, wall area, roof area, overall height, orientation, glazing area, and glazing area distribution, the model provides invaluable insights into a building's energy performance.</p>
                    <p>By harnessing the power of data-driven predictions, architects, engineers, and building professionals can:</p>
                    <ul class="benefits-list">
                        <li>Design more sustainable and energy-efficient buildings from the ground up</li>
                        <li>Optimize the sizing and placement of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems</li>
                        <li>Reduce energy costs and environmental impact</li>
                        <li>Improve occupant comfort and well-being</li>

                <p class="prediction-info">The model estimates the heating load and cooling load of buildings. Heating load refers to the amount of heat energy required to maintain a comfortable indoor temperature during cold weather, while cooling load represents the amount of heat that must be removed to keep the indoor temperature comfortable during hot weather.</p>
